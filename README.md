model.m is the main function <br>
noisyCAMPmmseforKLS.m and noisyCAMPmmseforKLSwithsi.m are used to calculate \eta for the case without si and with si respectively <br>
To plot the tradeoff curve, you need to tune on the threshold case by case. If you have any question or find any bug, you can contact me at: qipeng.wang@connect.polyu.hk
