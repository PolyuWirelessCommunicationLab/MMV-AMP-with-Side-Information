# Introduction
The code is for side information-aided approximate message passing algorithm with side information-aided MMSE denoiser.
model.m is the main function <br>
noisyCAMPmmseforKLS.m is the tradition AMP algorithm without SI <br>
noisyCAMPmmseforKLSSI. is the proposed SI-aided AMP algorithm <br>
threshPrimeThreshComplexGaussian.m is used to calculate the prime in the traditional AMP algorithm <br>
threshPrimeThreshComplexGaussianwithSI.m is used to calculate the prime in the SI-aided AMP algorithm <br>
# Note
To plot tradeoff curve (Fig. 6a and Fig. 7a), the detection threshold may be modified case by case.
