# Introduction
The code is for side information-aided approximate message passing algorithm with side information-aided soft thresholding denoiser.
model.m is the main function <br>
mmvsoftthresholding.m is the SI-aided AMP algorithm, i.e., (6) and (7) in the paper <br>
calweight.m is used to calculated the weight based on Theorem 2 <br>
# Note
To plot tradeoff curve (Fig. 3a and Fig. 4a), the detection threshold may be modified case by case.
